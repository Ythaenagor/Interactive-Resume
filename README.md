# Ethan Shilo-Draper's Interactive Resume
Hello! I'm Ethan, and this is an interactive version of my resume I built to demonstrate my skills. It is built entirely in React.js. I hope you enjoy it, and thank you for your time and consideration! I look forward to hearing from you!

### Known issues
- during room transition, some objects appear slightly higher than their final location
- if movement keys are pressed and released with precise timing during room transition, the avatar can temporarily be stuck moving in a certain direction. Due to the inconsistency and precise timing, this will remain unaddressed for now.
